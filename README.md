# University_Motor-Pool

Firstly, the information system is modelled using EER(Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram) and Relational schema which layed an idea on how to create the database. Both the files are attached in svg format.

The sql file(University Motor Pool - DDL,DML,3 Q_s.sql) has Data Description Language and Data Manipulation Language with which I have created and populated the database with relevant information for the University Motor Pool. 

I have 3 queries which retrive some useful information from the database 

Q1. We want to know the mvr from the information of the driver of a certain vehicle.
Taking VIN = “1GNDV23L26D236839” as an example.

Q2. We want to know how many deficiency points a driver currently has given the MVR form ID.

Q3. We want to know the insurance information of all Rental vehicles which their driver submitted a mvr form.
